# todo-list

## What is it?

This will be a todo list that shows you hours 9 - 5 and you can input and save your text for each hour. This program will be using moment to keep track of time and compare the time to each hour block to see if the hour is currently past, present, or future.

Saving the text will save it to local storage so when you refresh the page your list will still be there. The save functionality will only be applied to individual rows, so you must save the row if you want your list to stay, the save button will not save the entire page, just the current row.
